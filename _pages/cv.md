Education
======
* B.S. in School of Computer Science, Fudan University, 2020-2024

Research Interests
======
* **Generalism**: Extending LLM capabilities to new domains and tasks and building more general natural language processing (NLP) systems through unified algorithms and theories.

* **Trustworthy ML/NLP**: Unbiasedness, Robustness, Interpretability (How can we make sure that the model doesn't confound by the potential bias existing in the training data and outputs conform to facts? Does the model has the ability to generalize well when cross-domain? ...)

* **Causality for NLP**: Towards the well combination of Causality and NLP model to improve the efficiency of current statistical model with the capacity of casual inference.


Research Experience
======
* 2021.07-present: Fudan NLP Lab
  * Project 1: Causality & Implict Sentiment Analysis (published in COLING 2022)
  * Project 2: Causality & Domain generalization (under review)
  * Supervisor: Postdoc Jie Zhou and Prof. Xuanjing Huang

Service & Leadership
======
* 2022.02 - 2023.02: Deputy Director of Youth Volunteers' Centre
  * School of Computer Science, Fudan University
  * *Jishu Talk*: co-founded the first technological talk by the youth, for the youth in Fudan University, which serves as a great platform for undergraduates to communicate and learn some basic skills not taught in class (like Python, Linux) as well as new fields (like ACM, CTF). 300+ participated in first (2022 Autumn).

* 2020.09 - present: Member of Fudan Poetry Society
