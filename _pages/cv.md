Education
======
* PhD in School of Computer Science, Fudan University, 2024-present
* B.S. in School of Computer Science, Fudan University, 2020-2024

Research Interests
======
* **AI Safety&Alignment**: Developing artificial general intelligence (AGI) to be more helpful, honest, and harmless, as well as more reliable, robust, and generally aligned with human values and follow human intent.

* **Trustworthy ML/NLP**: Unbiasedness, Robustness, Interpretability (How can we make sure that the model doesn't confound by the potential bias existing in the training data and outputs conform to facts? Does the model has the ability to generalize well when cross-domain? ...)

* **Language Grounding in Multimodal Embodied Intelligence**: Exploring how language grounding can be integrated with vision, speech, robotics, and other modalities to create embodied intelligent systems.

<!-- * **Causality for NLP**: Towards the well combination of Causality and NLP model to improve the efficiency of current statistical model with the capacity of casual inference. -->


Research Experience
======
* 2021.07-2023.07: Fudan NLP Lab
  * Project 1: Causality & Implict Sentiment Analysis (published in COLING 2022)
  * Project 2: Causality & Domain generalization (published in LREC-COLING 2024)
  * Supervisor: Postdoc Jie Zhou and Prof. Xuanjing Huang

* Contemporary Undergraduate Mathematical Contest in Modeling (CUMCM), First prize (*Top 0.6% of 49242 teams*), 2022.09     
* Outstanding Graduate Star Award of Fudan University （*10 recipients university-wide*）    

  
Service & Leadership
======
* Reviewer / Program Committee Member: EMNLP 2023, NAACL 2025, ACL 2025
* Student Union President (2023-2024)
  * School of Computer Science, Fudan University
  * *Jishu Talk*: co-founded the first technological talk by the youth, for the youth in Fudan University, which serves as a great platform for undergraduates to communicate and learn some basic skills not taught in class (like Python, Linux) as well as new fields (like ACM, CTF). 300+ participated in first (2022 Autumn).
