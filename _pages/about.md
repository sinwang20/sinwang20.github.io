I am currently a PhD student at Fudan University. I am advised by Prof.[Xipeng Qiu](https://xpqiu.github.io/en.html). I received my Bachelor's degree from Fudan University, where I conducted research under the supervision of Prof. Jie Zhou and Prof. [Xuanjing Huang](https://xuanjing-huang.github.io/) in [Fudan NLP Lab](https://nlp.fudan.edu.cn/).
                
My research interests lie in language intelligence, with a focus on LLM alignment, multimodality, embodied AI, etc.
