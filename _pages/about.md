I am currently a 3-rd undergraudate student at Fudan University. I am advised by postdoc Jie Zhou and Prof.[Xuanjing Huang](https://xuanjing-huang.github.io/) in [Fudan NLP Lab](https://nlp.fudan.edu.cn/).
                
I have broad interests in natural language processing and machine learning, including causality, sentiment analysis, etc.
                
I am planning to apply for the PhD program starting in Fall 2024, and any advice would be greatly appreciated.
